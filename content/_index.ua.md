# Робочий стіл Regolith

![](/regolith-empty.png)

{{< columns >}}

### Продуктивність Понад Усе

Regolith заснований на [i3](https://i3wm.org/): поширеному, швидкому, та настроюваному мозаїчному менеджері вікон, що чудово підходить для швидкого робочого процеса з використанням гарячих клавіш. Regolith поєднує i3 з іншими компонентами робочого столу, такими як  `i3bar`, `rofication`, `gnome-flashback`, та  [`ilia`](https://github.com/regolith-linux/ilia#readme), щоб надати повний інтерфейс робочого столу.

<--->

### GNOME System Management

By providing a gnome session with [`gnome-flashback`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeFlashback), Regolith sidesteps
much of the complexity of a typical `gnome-shell` based environment while providing
simple and consistent system management capabilities.

# Get Regolith 2.1

{{< tabs "uniqueid" >}}
{{< tab "Ubuntu 22.04" >}}

Regolith can be installed as system packages.  This makes updating and removing easier and more consistent.  The following steps (also available as a [downloadable script](/install-release-ubuntu-22.04-amd64.txt)) describe how
to configure your system to read packages from the Regolith package repository and install the desktop package.

1. Register the Regolith public key to your local `apt`:

   ```console
   wget -qO - https://regolith-desktop.org/regolith.key | \
   gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
   ```

1. Add the repository URL to your local `apt`:

   ```console
   echo deb "[arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg] \
   https://regolith-desktop.org/release-ubuntu-jammy-amd64 jammy main" | \
   sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/regolith.list
   ```

{{< hint info >}}
Substitute `arm64` for `amd64` in the two places in the above line to install on ARM-based systems.
{{< /hint >}}

1. Update `apt` and install Regolith

   ```console
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install regolith-desktop
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

{{< hint info >}}
The `regolith-desktop` package installs a reasonable minimal configuration that should work on most hardware. To add additional package for a richer and more functional environment read [Recommended Packages for New Users](/docs/using-regolith/configuration/#recommended-packages-for-new-users).
{{< /hint >}}

1. System Restart

The login manager will need to be restarted for the new desktop session to be recognized. The easiest way of restarting it is to reboot your system.

{{< hint warning >}}
The Regolith Desktop is very different from common desktop environments. By default it does not use docks, icon folders, or global drop-down menus.  See the [Getting Started guide]({{< ref "/docs/using-regolith/first-launch" >}}) for important details.

{{< tab "Regolith Linux 2.1 ISO" >}} 

Regolith Linux is the Regolith Desktop environment installed into a customized Ubuntu 22.04 installer image.  It allows one to boot from a USB drive to run Regolith without having to install it. It also allows to install the system onto a computer's drive.  Regolith Linux has the following features in addition to the Regolith Desktop:

* Regolith-branded boot and login screens
* Uses the `lightdm` display manager over `gdm3` to avoid unneeded dependencies
* The following packages are not installed: `gdm3`, `gnome-shell`, `ubuntu-session`, `evolution-data-server`, `snapd`.  These packages may be installed as needed by the user.

The ISO comes in two forms, a "mini" ISO which includes a paired down experience and only includes the default look.  The default ISO is somewhat bigger but includes built-in support for all official Looks and comes installed with a few more status indicators.

* [Regolith Linux 2.1.1](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-ubuntu-iso-builder/releases/download/ubuntu-jammy-2.1.1-20220807_181202/regolith-ubuntu-jammy-2.1.1.zip)
* [Regolith Linux 2.1.1 Mini](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-ubuntu-iso-builder/releases/download/mini-ubuntu-jammy-2.1.1-20220807_180918/regolith-mini-ubuntu-jammy-2.1.1.zip)

See the [Regolith 2.1 release notes](docs/reference/Releases/regolith-2.1-release-notes) for more information.

The ISO can be written to a USB drive on Linux using [dd](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html), [GNOME Disk Utility](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Disks), or the [KDE ISO Image Writer](https://community.kde.org/ISOImageWriter). On macOS, use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). On Windows, use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) and write in DD mode.

{{< tab "Upgrade from Regolith 1.6" >}}

To install Regolith 2 into an existing Ubuntu system that is upgrading to 22.04, follow these steps:

1. Upgrade the system to all the latest packages on current release (either Ubuntu 20.04 or 21.10)
1. Perform the [Ubuntu system upgrade to 22.04](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/04/how-to-upgrade-to-ubuntu-22-04-lts), however **DO NOT** reboot as prompted **until the following steps are completed**
1. After the 22.04 upgrade completes, add the Regolith 2 package repository:

   ```console
   wget -qO - https://regolith-desktop.org/regolith.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
   echo deb "[arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg] https://regolith-desktop.org/release-ubuntu-jammy-amd64 jammy main" | \
   sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/regolith.list
   sudo apt update
   ```

1. Next install the Regolith 2 desktop package:

   ```console
   sudo apt install regolith-desktop
   sudo apt dist-upgrade
   ```

{{< hint info >}}
The `regolith-desktop` package installs a reasonable minimal configuration that should work on most hardware. To add additional package for a richer and more functional environment read [Recommended Packages for New Users](/docs/using-regolith/configuration/#recommended-packages-for-new-users).
{{< /hint >}}

1. Now reboot the system and select the regolith session at the login screen

Custom configurations from Regolith 1.6 will need to be manually ported to Regolith 2.  In order to make this upgrade simpler, Regolith 2 uses the user config directory of `~/.config/regolith2`.  It will not read files from the Regolith 1.x user config directory `~/.config/regolith`.  Please refer to [the configuration page](docs/using-regolith/configuration) for more details.
